\title{Compares one column against patterns}
\usage{
match_pattern(df, colname, lst_pattern, strict = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a data frame.}

\item{colname}{a character string specifying the colonne to compare against
the list of pattern.}

\item{lst_pattern}{a named list of pattern, should contains one or multiple
vector. Each slot should be named.}

\item{strict}{a boolean to indicate if the character string should match only
some value in the vector (FALSE) or all values (TRUE) on the list of pattern.}
}
\value{
\code{match_pattern} In case of a matching, the function will return
a character vector, if not, it will return NULL
}
\description{

\examples{

# To look at the year of expression of the province in Vietnam from a
# gdpm data frame (epidemiologic data from Vietnam)
library(gdpm)

df <- getid(dengue, from = 1980, to = 1982) # get data for dengue for Vietnam
# Allows to check the spatial expression is corresponding to the year
match_pattern(df, "province", vn_province_year)
